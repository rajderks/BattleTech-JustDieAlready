# BT: JustDieAlready
Sometimes a mech won't die even though it's center torso is 0/xxx, the pilot ejected or got killed.   
This would softlock the game as objectives never got completed and would forego death-animations.   
This patch fixes the softlocking and thus objectives can be completed, mechs will actually die and death-animations will run.   
This mod is compatible with RogueTech(https://www.nexusmods.com/battletech/mods/79?tab=description).
